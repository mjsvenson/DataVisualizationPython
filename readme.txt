What is this project?

This project uses the data in the file "iris.csv" and creates plots 
using that data. The first image is an all in one plot. This graph
uses the data from all the species of flowers and plots it all on one 
graph. The species are seperated by color and marker. The second set of graphs seperates
the species into seperate graphs and plots them accordingly.
